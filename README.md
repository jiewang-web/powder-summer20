# REU Summer 2020 Powder Project! #
### Currently this repository is broken down into three main pieces: ###
* **all-code folder:** this is where all the code I wrote this summer is located. Most was not used in my final project, but was used as I worked through my problem and solution.

* **tutorials folder:** this is where the tutorials for using the code found in the all-code folder will be located. This section can be broken down even further into two goals:
  * *collect-rxtx-all:* here I will be explaining and working through my process for collected recieved signal strength data for every combination of transmitter and receiver within the Powder testbed at a singular point in time.
  * *collect-power-weather:* here I will be explaining and working through my process for gathering both recieved signal strength and weather data for an extended period of time. I will also explain my analysis of the data I have collected so far in this section. 
  
* **presentations-and-paper folder:** this is where all my up-to-date presentations and paper rough drafts can be found. Looking through both the presentation and paper could be benefitial to understanding the context of my project
